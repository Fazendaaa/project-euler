                                Pandigital products

    We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
    digits  1  to  n  exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1
    through 5 pandigital.

    The  product  7254  is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
    multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

    Find  the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
    can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

    HINT:  Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
    include it once in your sum.

            This one helped a lot because I was using 10 000 as limit instead of
            4 999 and 99
