> **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)** is a good site with challenging exercises for those who already have a solid computer science knowledge and are willing to take a step further.

## Tasks

I gave myself the freedom to copy and paste the exercises descriptions, given it some proper modification to better suits my need to understand it. The task itself is has its number in the source file.

All of the status of the file or even updates are explained in the Github's commits.

All tasks are implemented in the following languages, that the directories are represented by. Until now:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Status

Not all of the tasks are finished, some languages have more completed tasks than others. This a life time project of learning and self-improvement, in other words... "Cut me some slack".

### Dependencies

The tasks are bundle together in folders given the unlocked achievements which are each of 25 tasks. Besides that when the exercise need some input of large amount of data, the needed input will be stored in a __.txt__ file in the _inputs_ folder.

## References

All of the references used in the exercise development are equally listed at the end of each description. From a webpage that I've used to better understand some computer concept behind it, a math one or even to help me see the real problem the task itself.

Some of the most used references:

* [Wikip√©dia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
* [MathBlog](http://www.mathblog.dk/category/solutions/project-euler/)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
* [Theorical Computer Science](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/)

## Code

I always tried to comment the code, in my best English, to improve some code writing stepping up its clarity.

In case that any doubt are raised, give me a heads up.

## License

Just see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.
