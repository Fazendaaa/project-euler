> **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)** is a good website with challenging exercises for those who already have a solid computer science knowledge and are willing to take a step further.

## Tasks
I gave myself the freedom to copy and paste the exercises descriptions, given it some proper modification to better suits my need to understand it. The task itself is has its number in the source file.

The languages that I want to learn are equally listed here as well, but they have none of the tasks implemented yet.

All of the status of the file or even updates are explained in the Github's commits.

All tasks are implemented in the following languages, that the directories are represented by. Until now:

* [C](https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html)
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com)
* [Cobol](https://open-cobol.sourceforge.io/)
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
* [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org/)
* [Java](https://java.com/)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* [Lisp](http://lisp-lang.org/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
    * [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org/)
* [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Swift](https://swift.org/)

### Status
Not all of the tasks are finished, some languages have more completed tasks than others. This a life time project of learning and self-improvement, deadlines are not the objective here.

### Dependencies
The tasks are bundle together in folders given the unlocked achievements which are each of 25 tasks. Besides that when the exercise need some input of large amount of data, the needed input will be stored in a __.txt__ file in the _inputs_ folder.

#### Install
Some implementations might require third-parties packages so, before run it, see the code for any outsider _import_ and look up online how to install it and then run it as usually.

## References
All of the references used in the exercise development are equally listed at the end of each description. From a webpage that I've used to better understand some computer concept behind it, a math one or even to help me see the real problem the task itself.

Some of the most used references:

* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
* [MathBlog](http://www.mathblog.dk/category/solutions/project-euler/)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
* [Theorical Computer Science](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/)

Maybe, some day, I will do some benchmarks to compare each problem, the languages and it's performance to see the pros and cons of each one, and then publish it.

## Code
I always tried to comment the code, in my best English, to improve some code writing stepping up its clarity.

In case that any doubt are raised, give me a heads up.

## License
Just see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.

## Authors
* Only [me](https://github.com/Fazendaaa)

I intend to keep this way since is a personal project of self improvement. But fell free to fork and modify some of my implementations and do it your own, taking some steps that I did not.

## Contributing
I won't be opening this to any kind of Pull Request, but if you ran to some problems run it or some dependencies is not available, the logic only works for that given case, etc; fell free to contact me that I will see to fix it and will give you the merit for point out this problem.
