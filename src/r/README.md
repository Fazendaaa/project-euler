If you decide to run all of the pipe integration, a Docker image containing all dependencies are presented in [r-testing](https://hub.docker.com/r/fazenda/r-testing/) docker hub.

## API
This package has a website presenting all the APIs configurations and usage, followed by some examples, to build it just:
```shell
R -e "pkgdown::build_site()"
```

## Tests
To run all the [tests](./tests) just run trough:
```shell
R -e "devtools::document();devtools::test()"
```

You need to to run `devtools::document()` because of the Rcpp implementations presented in [src](./src)

The site configurations are presented in the [_pkgdown.yml](./_pkgdown.yml) file. As the keys to the [docsearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) to run the indexing presented in the search bar.

## Code
Code following the standards in presented in the [.lintr](./.lintr) file.
