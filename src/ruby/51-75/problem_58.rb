									Spiral primes
	
	Starting  with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square
	spiral with side length 7 is formed.

								37 36 35 34 33 32 31
								38 17 16 15 14 13 30
								39 18  5  4  3 12 29
								40 19  6  1  2 11 28
								41 20  7  8  9 10 27
								42 21 22 23 24 25 26
								43 44 45 46 47 48 49

	It  is  interesting to  note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
	diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying
	along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

	If  one  complete  new  layer  is  wrapped around the spiral above, a square
	spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what
	is  the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along
	both diagonals first falls below 10%?
