                            Coded triangle numbers

    The  nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1);
    so the first ten triangle numbers are:

                    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

    By  converting  each  letter  in  a  word  to  a number corresponding to its
    alphabetical  position  and  adding  these  values we form a word value. For
    example,  the  word  value  for  SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word
    value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

    Using  words.txt,  a  16K  text  file  containing nearly two-thousand common 
    English words, how many are triangle words?
