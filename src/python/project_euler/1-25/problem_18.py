                            Maximum path sum I

    By  starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers
    on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

                                   3
                                  7 4
                                 2 4 6
                                8 5 9 3

    That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
    Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

    NOTE:  As  there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem
    by  trying  every  route.  However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a
    triangle  containing  one-hundred  rows; it cannot be solved by brute force,
    and requires a clever method! ;o)
