                                Digit fifth powers

    Surprisingly  there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of
    fourth powers of their digits:

                            1634 = 1**4 + 6**4 + 3**4 + 4**4
                            8208 = 8**4 + 2**4 + 0**4 + 8**4
                            9474 = 9**4 + 4**4 + 7**4 + 4**4

    As 1 = 1**4 is not a sum it is not included.

    The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

    Find  the  sum  of  all  the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth
    powers of their digits.

    obs: since the problem for me is the upper bound I looked for help:
