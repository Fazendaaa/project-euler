#                     Longest Collatz sequence
#
# The  following  iterative  sequence  is  defined  for  the  set  of positive
# integers:
#
#                         n → n/2 (n is even)
#                         n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
#
# Using  the  rule  above  and  starting  with  13,  we generate the following
# sequence:
#
#             13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
#
# It  can  be  seen  that  this  sequence  (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
# contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it
# is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
#
# Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
#
# NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
