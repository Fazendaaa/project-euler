--                             Names scores

-- Using  problem_22.txt,  a  46K text file containing over five-thousand first
-- names,  begin  by  sorting  it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
-- alphabetical  value  for  each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical
-- position in the list to obtain a name score.

-- For  example,  when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which
-- is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
-- would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
