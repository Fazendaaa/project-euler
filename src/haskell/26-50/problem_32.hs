--                             Pandigital products

-- We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
-- digits  1  to  n  exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1
-- through 5 pandigital.

-- The  product  7254  is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
-- multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

-- Find  the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
-- can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

-- HINT:  Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
-- include it once in your sum.
